## Tech StackThe easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.



- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form + Zod
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ installed
- A Supabase account (free tier works fine)

### 2. Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Wait for the project to be set up (takes ~2 minutes)
3. Go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
4. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-migration.sql` and run it
5. This will create the `interview_experiences` table with proper indexes and RLS policies

### 3. Get Supabase Credentials

1. In your Supabase project, go to **Settings** â†’ **API**
2. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL** (NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL)
   - **anon/public key** (NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
   - **service_role key** (SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY) - Keep this secret!

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

2. Edit `.env.local` and add your Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_admin_password_here
   ```

3. Choose a strong admin password for the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` field

### 5. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### 7. Test the Application

1. **Submit an experience**: Go to http://localhost:3000/submit
2. **Access admin panel**: Go to http://localhost:3000/admin
3. **Login**: Use the password you set in `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
4. **Approve a submission**: Review and approve the test submission
5. **View public page**: Go back to http://localhost:3000 to see the approved entry

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import the project in Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel project settings:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
4. Deploy!

### Important Security Notes

- Never commit `.env.local` to git (it's in `.gitignore`)
- The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` bypasses Row Level Security - keep it secret
- Change the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` to something strong and unique
- Admin authentication is simple password-based - for production, consider using Supabase Auth

## API Routes

### Public Routes

- `PATCH /api/admin/submissions` - Update a submission (approve/reject/edit)
- `DELETE /api/admin/submissions?id=<id>` - Delete a submission
- `GET /api/admin/export` - Export approved submissions to CSV

## Customization

### Changing Colors/Theme

Edit `app/globals.css` to customize the color scheme. The app uses Tailwind CSS and CSS variables for theming.

### Adding More Fields

1. Update `lib/database.types.ts` with new field
2. Add field to Supabase table via SQL
3. Update validation schema in submission form
4. Update form UI in `app/submit/page.tsx`
5. Update display in `app/page.tsx` and `app/admin/page.tsx`

### Modifying Search Behavior

The search is currently case-insensitive and searches across:
- Interview questions
- Advice/tips
- Position
- Company name

To modify, edit the `filterExperiences` function in `app/page.tsx`.

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch experiences"
- Check that Supabase credentials are correct in `.env.local`
- Verify the database table was created successfully
- Check browser console for specific errors

### "Unauthorized" in admin panel
- Verify `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env.local` matches what you're entering
- Clear browser localStorage and try again
- Check that environment variables are loaded (restart dev server)

### Submissions not appearing
- Submissions start in "pending" status
- Only "approved" submissions appear on the public page
- Login to admin panel to approve them
